/**
 * Comprehensive tests for the Game class
 * Tests game initialization, player management, turn progression, and victory conditions
 * Covers the core game loop mechanics of the Coup card game including:
 * - Player registration and validation (2-6 players required)
 * - Turn-based gameplay with proper cycling
 * - Winner determination when only one player remains active
 * - Game state management and error handling
