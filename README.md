# Coup Card Game

A feature-rich, GUI-based implementation of the popular card game **Coup** built in C++ using the SFML graphics library. This project recreates the strategic bluffing and deduction game with original character roles, each having unique abilities that affect gameplay dynamics.

## Introduction

Coup is a strategic card game for 2-6 players where participants take on different roles in a dystopian future, using influence and deception to eliminate opponents and be the last player standing. This implementation features:

- **GUI-based gameplay** using SFML for an intuitive gaming experience
- **Six unique character roles** with distinct abilities and gameplay mechanics
- **Turn-based strategy** with both basic and special actions
- **Real-time interaction** through a modern graphical interface
- **Comprehensive testing suite** ensuring robust game logic

### Character Roles

The game includes six specialized roles, each with unique abilities:

- **Governor** - Enhanced taxation (3 coins instead of 2) and can undo other players' tax actions
- **Spy** - Intelligence gatherer who can reveal opponent coins and block arrest actions
- **Baron** - Investment specialist who can triple coins (pay 3, get 6) and receives compensation when sanctioned
- **General** - Can block coup attempts for 5 coins and has defensive capabilities  
- **Judge** - Can block bribe actions and imposes penalties on attackers
- **Merchant** - Generates passive income and has alternative payment methods for penalties
